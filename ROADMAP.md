# OpenWhisper Future Roadmap & Architecture Specification

This document details upcoming improvements, architectural additions, and multi-platform implementations planned for future releases of **OpenWhisper**.

## 1. Multi-Platform Backends

While OpenWhisper currently targets Linux on Wayland (Fedora / KDE Plasma 6), the core architecture (in-memory audio processing, Whisper client, dual-mode hotkey engine, VAD, sound generation, and floating HUD overlay) is fully cross-platform. Platform-specific backends are planned as follows:

### A. macOS Support
- **Audio Capture**: Built-in support via `cpal` CoreAudio host.
- **Global Hotkeys**:
  - Global keydown and keyup capture for PTT via `CGEventTap` or `rdev`.
  - Permission management via macOS Accessibility APIs (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`).
- **Text Insertion**:
  - Direct clipboard copy via `arboard` (`NSPasteboard`).
  - Keystroke synthesis for `Cmd+V` via `CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent(NULL, (CGKeyCode)9, true)` (`kVK_ANSI_V`) with `kCGEventFlagMaskCommand`.
- **System Integration**:
  - Status bar menu extra via native AppKit `NSStatusItem` or `tray-icon`.
  - User session background daemon managed via `~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.local.openwhisper.plist`.

### B. Windows Support
- **Audio Capture**: Built-in support via `cpal` WASAPI host.
- **Global Hotkeys**:
  - For Toggle mode: Win32 `RegisterHotKey`.
  - For PTT mode: Low-level keyboard hook via `SetWindowsHookExW(WH_KEYBOARD_LL, ...)` to track keydown and keyup events with high precision.
- **Text Insertion**:
  - Direct clipboard copy via `arboard`.
  - Keystroke synthesis for `Ctrl+V` via Win32 `SendInput` (`VK_CONTROL` and `0x56`).
  - Optional direct text insertion using `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` for instantaneous character streaming.
- **System Integration**:
  - System tray icon via Win32 `Shell_NotifyIcon` or `tray-icon`.
  - Background autostart via Windows Registry Run key or Windows Service.

### C. iOS Architecture
- **Audio Engine**: `AVAudioEngine` / `AudioUnit` input node.
- **Core Library**:
  - Modularize the core pipeline into `openwhisper-core` compiled as a universal static library (`.xcframework`) using UniFFI or C-FFI.
- **User Interface & Extension**:
  - Custom Keyboard Extension providing a dictation button inside any iOS app, inserting text directly via `UITextDocumentProxy.insertText()`.
  - SwiftUI companion application for server configuration, model selection, and prompt management.

## 2. Streaming & Real-Time Dictation

### Motivation
For lengthy dictation sessions, seeing words appear in real time reduces perceived latency and provides immediate feedback on speech recognition accuracy.

### Architecture & Protocol
- **Chunked Audio Streaming**:
  - Stream PCM chunks over WebSocket or chunked HTTP transfer encoding to streaming-capable backends (e.g., OpenVINO Model Server gRPC/WebSocket streaming endpoints, Faster-Whisper live streaming server, or WhisperLive).
- **Buffer Synchronization**:
  - Continuous interim transcription tokens are received asynchronously.
  - Implement delete-and-replace buffer updating:
    - Track the character length of the last interim token sequence.
    - Emit backspaces or replacement sequences to rewrite the active draft as Whisper's language model refines word choices based on extended acoustic context.
  - On release/silence, lock the finalized transcript into the active document.
